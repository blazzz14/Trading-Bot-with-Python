# Trading-Bot-with-Python
**USE LOGIC AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This is a simple trading Bot project that looks to buy and sell financial instruments.
In this case, I chose to focus on Cryptocurrency trading on the largest exchange, Binance.
This is due to the fact that there are extensive Binance libraries and modules available,
which cuts down development time. 

#Files
1. Binance_trade9_plot.py. Python file that uses the Matplotlib library to plot live prices
   on a line chart.
   You will need to generate your own API key and API secret on Binance.
2. Trading Bot Pseudocode.txt
   This is a text file that contains how one might structure trading logic.
   Functions like place_buy_order, place_sell_order, and get_asset_balance will need to be drafted
   in order to interact with the Binance API. You would need to implement these functions according
   to the Binance API documentation and your specific needs.
